A collection of various programming experiments and ideas in their nascent stages.
It's a space for trial, error, drafts, fast iteration, deliberate practice, and wild messy code.

## Structure

- Experiments: Housed in individual directories under `/src/route`.
- Special Requirements: Some projects may need unique setups like databases or specific environments.

Explore at your leisure.\
Feel free to use any useful elements you find.

Ideas here may continue their life in dedicated repositories, some public, some private, if they prove valuable.
